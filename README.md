```

### 2. üì• Repository cloning

### 3. üß© Dependencies installation

Use pip (or pip3, if there's a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. üóùÔ∏è Environment variables setup

To set up your environment variables, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. If you already have a `.env.example` file, you can simply copy with rename it to `.env` using the command `cp .env.example .env`. Once you've done this, add or/and fill the following lines by values in your `.env` file:

- **`BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`**:
    - This is your unique token for accessing the bit.ly API.
    - To obtain it:
        1. Register on [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/).
        2. Once registered, navigate to [this settings page](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/).
        3. Enter your password in the "Enter password" field.
        4. Click on "Generate token".
        5. You'll be provided with a token - this is your `BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    - Place this token in your `.env` file as:
        ```
        BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_generated_token_here
        ```
		Replace `your_generated_token_here` with the token you obtained from the bit.ly settings page.

Please ensure that each environment variable is assigned the correct value.
